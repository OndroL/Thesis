Domain Classes for Binary Data Deserialization
The migration process includes domain-specific classes that represent objects serialized as binary data in the old schema. These classes are essential for correctly interpreting and transforming the stored data into the new jsonb format.

These classes:
 - Represent the structure of the data stored as binary objects in the database.
 - Are used during the deserialization process to reconstruct the original object for JSON conversion.

Without these classes:
 - Binary data stored in the legacy schema cannot be properly deserialized.
 - Migration would fail to interpret and transform this data into JSON, leading to incomplete or incorrect records.
